# Crisis Management Platform
 This is a website that I created at the Shankara Global Hackathon (SITE-2024). It contains an ML Model for fire detection using the camera's IP address. We also included a Weather report API. Our future plan for this website is to add an alert system for fire detection and a rainfall prediction model.


To view the website, copy the repo into the system, open the crisis_management_platform folder, and then inedx.html. This will open the webpage in your browser.
To view the ML Project first run app.py then view the website.

At this Hackathon,

- Led the Team of 6 members and made a Crisis Management Platform for the Shankara Global Hackathon (SITE-2024).
- Integrated an AI model for fire detection using camera input, achieving over 95% detection accuracy.
- Incorporated IP integration and a weather report API to enhance situational awareness for users by 50%.
