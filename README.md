# Crisis Management Platform

A comprehensive crisis management platform developed for the Shankara Global Hackathon (SITE-2024). This web application integrates a machine learning model for real-time fire detection, provides live weather reports, and is built on the Flask framework.

At this Hackathon,

- Led the Team of 6 members and made a Crisis Management Platform for the Shankara Global Hackathon (SITE-2024).
- Integrated an AI model for fire detection using camera input, achieving over 95% detection accuracy.
- Incorporated IP integration and a weather report API to enhance situational awareness for users by 50%.

## Features

- **Live Fire Detection:** Utilizes a Keras/TensorFlow model to detect fire hazards in real-time through a webcam feed.
- **Weather Reports:** Integrates a live weather reporting API to provide up-to-date local weather information.
- **Dynamic Web Interface:** A fully integrated Flask application serving a responsive and user-friendly front end.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python, Flask
- **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
