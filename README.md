# Crisis Management Platform
 This is a website which I created on SITE-24 Hackathon. In the website their is a ML Model for fire detection using camera's IP address. We also put a Weather report API in this website. Our future plan for this website is to add an alart system for fire detection and a rainfall prediction model.


To view the website, copy the repo into the system, open the crisis_management_platform folder then inedx.html. This will open the webpage on your browser.
To view the ML Project first run app.py then view in the website.
